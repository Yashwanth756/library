# Library Assistant System

Welcome to the **Library Assistant System**, an innovative platform combining artificial intelligence, voice processing, and interactive virtual animation to provide users with an engaging experience while exploring library resources.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Library Assistant System** is designed to help users interact with a vast array of library resources, such as books, authors, and descriptions, using voice commands. With an AI-powered model at its core, the system accurately processes user queries and provides relevant information with ease.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Driven Query Processing**: Trained on comprehensive library data to understand and process a wide range of user queries.
- **Voice Recognition**: Supports natural spoken commands, allowing users to interact hands-free.
- **Realistic Virtual Avatar**: Designed using the **SmartBody** platform, the avatar provides lifelike speech and lip-sync features.
- **ActiveMQ Communication**: Facilitates real-time, seamless communication between system components, ensuring smooth user interaction.
- **Interactive Experience**: Dynamic, personalized responses with synchronized facial expressions, creating an intuitive and engaging environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **AI & NLP**: Gemmini Model (for query processing)
- **Voice Recognition**: For natural language input
- **Avatar Creation**: SmartBody (for realistic avatar and lip-sync)
- **Communication**: ActiveMQ (for message queuing)
